# Mobile app for Lost Appple Project
Lost Apple Project (LAP) has a mission to locate & preserve heritage apple trees and orchards planted prior to 1920 in eastern Washington State. LAP volunteers seek to work with land owners to encourage the preservation of these trees. 

The LAP aims to search for a specific list of apple varieties that were known to have been grown in this area and are now considered extinct or lost. When lost varieties are rediscovered, steps will be taken to propagate the trees and make them available again to the public.
